Popular Extensions Icon Extractor
=================================

Simple Python script for Windows that extracts the icons of the extensions that have a default icon associated.

I coded it to get a set of popular icons of the common extensions.


Requirements
------------

+ Python
+ [IconsExtract](http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/iconsext.html)
+ [FileTypesMan](http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/file_types_manager.html)

Put FileTypesMan.exe and iconsext.exe in this directory.

Popular Extensions Icon Extractor (iconsextract.py)
===================================================

Simple Python script for Windows that extracts the icons of the extensions that have a default icon associated.

I coded it to get a set of popular icons of the common extensions.


Requirements
------------

+ Python (tested on 2.7 or 3.5)
+ [FileTypesMan](http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/file_types_manager.html)
+ [IconsExtract](http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/iconsext.html)

FileTypesMan.exe and iconsext.exe are downloaded automatically.
